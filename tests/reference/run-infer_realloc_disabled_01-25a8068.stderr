3 |     x = [1, 2, 3]
  |     ^ 'x' not allocated here
runtime warning: The array 'x' is being automatically reallocated, potentially slowing performance, due to LHS being size 3, and RHS being size 2. If this is intended, allocate explicitly before the assignment or use the '--realloc-lhs-arrays' option to suppress this warning.
