# This is a Spack Environment file.
#
# It describes a set of packages to be installed, along with
# configuration settings.
#
# Activate it with:
#
#     spack env activate .
#
# The first time you need to build all the packages in it:
#
#     spack install
#
# Then build LFortran as usual:
#
#     ./build0.sh
#     ./build1.sh
#
# And everything should be automatically found.

spack:
  # add package specs to the `specs` list
  specs: [python@3, cmake, llvm@14.0.0, py-toml@0.10.2, re2c@2.2, bison@3.4.2]
