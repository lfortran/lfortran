# This is a Spack Environment file.
#
# It describes a set of packages to be installed, along with
# configuration settings.
#
# Activate it with:
#
#     spack env activate .
#
# The first time you need to build all the packages in it:
#
#     spack install
#
# Then build LFortran as usual:
#
#     ./build.sh
#
# And everything should be automatically found.
